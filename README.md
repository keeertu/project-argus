# 🛡️ Project Argus

**AI-Powered Rental Scam Detection for Indian Cities**

Project Argus uses Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Sonnet to protect India's 15M+ renters from fraudulent rental listings. By analyzing price data, text patterns, and images, Argus provides real-time risk assessment to help renters make informed decisions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **₹500 Crore** lost annually to rental scams in India
- **1 in 4** rental listings contain suspicious elements
- **15M+** renters at risk across major Indian cities
- Scammers exploit urgency tactics, fake photos, and below-market pricing

## 💡 Solution

Project Argus provides instant AI-powered analysis of rental listings using:

1. **Price Analysis Engine** - Compares listing price against real market data for 40+ localities across 6 major Indian cities
2. **Text Analysis Engine** - Detects scam patterns like urgency tactics, advance payment pressure, and Hinglish spam phrases
3. **Image Analysis Engine** - Identifies stock photos, watermarks, and stolen property images
4. **AI Reasoning Engine** - LLM-powered (Bedrock) forensic explanations synthesizing all signals to explain the "why" behind the risk level.
5. **Risk Scoring Algorithm** - Weighted scoring (Price 40%, Text 40%, Image 20%) with actionable recommendations
